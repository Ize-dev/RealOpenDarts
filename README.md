# RealOpenDarts WIP
Open Source Darts Game for Android - Powered by Unity and Arduino, Compatible with Any Electric Dartboard

Currently, only the Arduino/ESP32 code is available.

I'm actively developing the Android app/client.

At launch, the client will support x01, Cricket, Around the World, and several other dart games, with the ability to accommodate up to 8 players per game.

I may include support for AutoDarts if I find the time to explore their API, potentially allowing cross-play between steel darts and electric boardsâ€”no promises though! ðŸ˜„

This project was inspired by OpenDarts, which, despite the name, is not actually open source. Therefore, I'll be releasing all my code and assets here for free.
